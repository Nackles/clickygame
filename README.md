## Bojack Horseman Clicky Game Instructions
Do you know the many faces of Bojack Horseman? Try to click all of them in a row to prove it. If you click one face twice before clicking the other eleven, it 's game over! Don't worry, you can try again as much as you like. No setup required!

## Known bugs
None! Click away.

## Challenges
The biggest challenge of this project was passing onClick events down to props. Once I figured that lego brick out, the rest fell right into place.

## Bonus Imgur Album
For my own convenience I hosted all of the images used in a hidden abum on imgur since I resized them manually.
